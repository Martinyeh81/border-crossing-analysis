# Border Crossing Analysis


## Problem
The Bureau of Transportation Statistics regularly makes available data on the number of vehicles, equipment, passengers and pedestrians crossing into the United States by land.

**For this challenge, I will calculate the total number of times vehicles, equipment, passengers and pedestrians cross the U.S.-Canadian and U.S.-Mexican borders each month. In addition, I will find the running monthly average of total number of crossings for that type of crossing and border from the input dataset provided to me.**
